          This Privacy Notice describes the privacy practices of Frndsmeet.com
          (“
          <strong>Frndsmeet</strong>”) and applies to all visitors of the
          Frndsmeet website and users of the Frndsmeet chat/video chat service
          ("you").

          <strong>
            We take Privacy Seriously, We do not in ANY MEANS save any of your

          In addition to any information contained in a Saved Chatlog, within

          categories of personal information from the following sources and
          disclosed for a business purpose to the following third parties:
        </p>
        <h2>Video Chat</h2>
        <p>
          Frndsmeet video chat service requires a direct connection to be made
          between your computer and the other user's computer. To do this, it is
          necessary to make your IP address available to the other user's
          computer, although it is not shown to the other user by Frndsmeet's
          interface. This is a necessary part of how any P2P video chat system
          functions.
        </p>
        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          Frndsmeet and its third-party service providers use cookies, tokens,
          widgets or other similar technologies (collectively “Cookies”) for
          certain features of the chat services to function. The Cookies collect
          personal information as follows.
        </p>

          and chat services safety and security purposes.
        </p>

        <p>

          preferences when using college mode and identifies your college’s
          domain name if you choose to use college mode. Your college domain
          name will be disclosed to the other user in your chat. Except for
          disclosure of your college domain name captured in a Saved Chatlog,
          Frndsmeet does not save information from College Cookies and only
          accesses the information for the purpose of fulfilling request to chat
          using the college mode feature.

          collects for one or more of the following business purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To fulfill or meet the reason you provided the information. For
            example, to provide the chat service.
          </li>
          <li>
            To help maintain the safety, security, and integrity of Frndsmeet’s
            site and chat services. For example, Frndsmeet may screen and use

          <li>
            To evaluate and improve the site and services. For example,
            Frndsmeet may aggregate and/or de-identify information to produce
            statistical data such as the average number of chats started at
            different times of day.
          </li>
          <li>
            To monitor and enforce user compliance with Frndsmeet’s
            <Link to="/Guidelines"> Guidelines</Link> and policies. For example,

            suspicious activity; and share the information with law enforcement.
          </li>
          <li>
            To respond to law enforcement requests and as required by applicable
            law, court order, or governmental regulations.
          </li>
          <li>
            To evaluate or conduct a merger, divestiture, restructuring,
            reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or
            all of Frndsmeet's assets, whether as a going concern or as part of
            bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal
            information held by Frndsmeet about our site and services users is
            among the assets transferred.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Frndsmeet will not collect additional categories of personal
          information or use the personal information we collected for
          materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without
          providing you notice.
        </p>
        <h2>Sharing Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
          Frndsmeet may disclose your personal information to a third party for
          a business purpose. When Frndsmeet discloses personal information for
          a business purpose, Frndsmeet enters a contract that describes the
          purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal
          information confidential and not use it for any purpose except
          performing the contract.

        <h2>Sales of Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
          Frndsmeet does not exchange your personal information for money. Like
          many other sites, Frndsmeet had a Facebook “like” button, Facebook
          “comments” plugin, Pinterest “pin” button, reddit “share” button, VK
          “share” button, and a Twitter “tweet” button embedded on the site. The
          use of these buttons and plugins may have constituted a “sale” of
          personal information under the CCPA. The buttons and plugins are no
          longer used. To the extent that the use of these buttons and plugins
          constituted a sale of personal information, in the preceding twelve
          (12) months, Frndsmeet used the buttons and plugins which allowed the
          internet or other similar network activity category of personal
          information to be shared with Facebook, Pinterest, reddit, VK, and
          Twitter.
